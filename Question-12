<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
and structure web pages. It provides the basic framework for websites by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. Without HTML, web browsers would not be able to display content correctly.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons HTML is important is its simplicity and accessibility. It is easy to learn and supported by all modern browsers. HTML also works together with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive websites.</p>
<p>In addition, HTML improves website accessibility and search engine
optimization by using semantic elements. This helps search engines and
assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of web
content.</p>
